# E-commerce app made with Next.js

WORK IN PROGRESS 

An e-commerce app built using Next.js, GraphQL and Apollo Client and using Keystone.js for backend.


## General info

This project was started as a way to practice React. As i wanted to dip my toes in to backend a bit more i've decided on using Next.js as my framework and to use Keystone.js as 
a way to set-up my backend. I've learned a great deal about how front-end interacts with backend and how to set up my own environment and a headless CMS. Next.js was 
a great choice because of its excellent CSR, SSR and routing. I've also learned how to create custom queries and mutation using GraphQL and how to use and optimize cache using the Apollo Client. As most of the Keystone.js is written in Typescript i've also dipped my toes in programming with Typescript although i still have to learn quite a bit more.

The projects has also allowed me to gain an insight how an e-commerce website works and all the intricacies from signing up to checking out products, payment and handling access and roles and permissions of different users. There are still things that i'm adding as it's a work in progress. Some of the things i'll be adding in the future:

  - Cart access if the user is not logged in
  - Roles and permissions
  - Styling (the app has very minimal styling at the moment)
  - Testing

## Installation
